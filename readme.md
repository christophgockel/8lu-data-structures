# 8LU - Data Structures

## Preparations

To make sure you have a smooth experience during the workshop make sure your development environment has everything that is needed.

To verify that, please `cd` into directory `01-intro` after cloning and execute `make`.

If that runs without errors you're good to go.
In case it doesn't you probably need to install the XCode command line tools.
